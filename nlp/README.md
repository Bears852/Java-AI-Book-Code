## ExtractNames - named entity recognition

The file test_data/propernames.ser is a serialized object file containing first names, last names, and place names.

Just for educational purposes, the class constructor writes these names to the text files firstnames.txt, lastnames.txt, and placenames.txt.

These text files are not used for anything except for giving you an easy way to see what entity name data we are using in this example.
