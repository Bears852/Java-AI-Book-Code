# Code for the 2020 edition of "Practical Artificial Intelligence With Java"

The previous edition was released in 2013. The new 2020 edition is largely a rewrite of older material with the addition of new material. The 2020 edition was published July 28, 2020 and this repository was updated to remove all old code and add new and modified examples. See below for information on getting the old code and the PDF for the 2013 edition.

This book is a combination of

- new coverage of deep learning
- new material: creating and using knowledge graphs
- examples from my discontinued book "Power Java": anomaly detection, linked data, using DBPedia, OpenNLP, and web scraping
- examples from the original editions of this book: genetic algorithms and search algorithms 
- a few examples updated from my discontinued book "Practical Semantic Web and Linked Data Applications, Java Edition"
